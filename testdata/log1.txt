World Heritage properties must display Outstanding Universal Value, which is the basis of any nomination. According to UNESCO, “Outstanding Universal Value means cultural and/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity. As such, the permanent protection of this heritage is of the highest importance to the international community as a whole.”
In order to be considered of Outstanding Universal Value, a property must meet one or more World Heritage Criteria.
